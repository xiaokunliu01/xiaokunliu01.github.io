## About Me

Hi, I am Xiaokun Liu, a postdoctoral researcher in bioinformatics at the Beijing Institute of Genomics (BIG), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) / National Genomics Data Center (NGDC).
I received my B.S. in Biotechnology from the University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB) in 2020, where I developed a strong foundation in molecular biology and data-driven life sciences. I then joined BIG to pursue my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics under the supervision of Dr. Xu, which I completed in January 2026. My doctoral research focused on 3D genome, during which I developed Footprint-C, a novel Hi-C method for mapping chromatin interactions with transcription factor resolution.
Following graduation, I continued as a postdoc in the same group to further explore 3D genome folding.
My work lies at the intersection of genomics and computational biology, with a long-term goal of deciphering the grammar of the genome.
